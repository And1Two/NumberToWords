This is a complete version of a task given to me to test my technical skills. I found the task interesting so I completed it to suit my requirements.

What exactly will the Scripts do:
Normally we wrote numbers with digits. But sometimes, we need the number written in words. And this is where the helper for PHP and JavaScript could come in handy.

i.e.

Integer:    42
In Words:   forty-two

Integer:    101
In Words:   one hundred one

Integer:    314159265358
In Words:   tree hundred fourteen trillion tree hundred fourteen billion one hundred fifty-nine million two hundred sixty-five thousand tree hundred fifty-eight


The JavaScript Code is mainly a Copy & Paste from the PHP Version with some minor changes and tweks. In Javascript i wont use variables that are names "number", because it could create confusion, regarding with the Number Object.


How to use with PHP:
1. Include the class number-to-word.php
2. Call the static method NumberToWords::getText([INTEGER])


How to use with JavaScript:
1. Include the Script number-to-words.js
2. Call the global function numberToWords([INTEGER])

Checkout the Example Files "index.php" and "example.html".
